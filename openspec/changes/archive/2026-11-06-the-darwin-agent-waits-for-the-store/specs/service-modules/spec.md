# Service modules

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: On nix-darwin the agent waits for the Nix store

The nix-darwin module's agent SHALL run its command behind `/bin/wait4path /nix/store`, the shell handing its process to the runner by `exec`, so an agent loaded before the Nix store's volume is mounted waits for it, and a stop's signal reaches the runner.

#### Scenario: The agent waits for the Nix store

- **WHEN** the module is enabled, with no `settings` or with a crew control plane's
- **THEN** the agent's program is `/bin/sh -c` with a line that runs `/bin/wait4path /nix/store`, then `exec`s the package's `boomdrive run --config` with the file

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A changed file or package restarts the runner, and nothing else does

On nix-darwin, the agent's program SHALL name the package and the file, so nix-darwin, which reloads an agent whose plist changed, reloads it when either changes and leaves it running when neither does. On NixOS, the module's user activation SHALL, for the service's user alone, start the unit where it is not running, restart it where the running runner's command line is not the unit's, and do nothing else.

#### Scenario: A new file on nix-darwin

- **WHEN** two configurations differ only in `settings.fetch_interval`
- **THEN** their agents' programs differ, in the file alone, and their plists differ

#### Scenario: A new package on nix-darwin

- **WHEN** two configurations differ only in `package`
- **THEN** their agents' programs differ, in the package alone, and their plists differ

#### Scenario: Nothing else changed on nix-darwin

- **WHEN** two configurations differ only in `tools`
- **THEN** their agents' plists are the same, byte for byte

#### Scenario: Not running on NixOS

- **WHEN** the activation runs for `alice` and the unit is not running
- **THEN** it starts the unit

#### Scenario: Nothing changed on NixOS

- **WHEN** the activation runs for `alice` and the running runner's command line is the unit's
- **THEN** it neither starts nor restarts the unit

#### Scenario: A new file on NixOS

- **WHEN** the activation runs for `alice` and the running runner's command line names another file
- **THEN** it restarts the unit

#### Scenario: Another user's activation

- **WHEN** the activation runs for `bob`
- **THEN** it starts, restarts and links nothing
